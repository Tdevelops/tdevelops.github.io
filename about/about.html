Over the past three years, I've worked with quite a number of clients and with amazing product teams, gaining expertise and experience with a wide array of exciting technologies in the process. I think I'd say that I'm an inquisitive person who's interested in the "why" of things, the human mind, Greek and Norse mythology, science fiction, and a few other... weird topics?
			I'm a back-end developer (although I have dabbled in the front-end here and there) who is often learning to reach the "senior" level of expertise, and in my free time, I like to build things for you and me. It's a fairly common misconception that I'm a nerd, but I'm not. You're pretty much exactly the type of person I want to hang out with if you're a fan of AJR (the band), Star Wars, or Star Trek (but I'd hang out with you even if you weren't). It also fascinates me to learn about and experiment with cutting-edge innovation, share my findings in "technical" articles, and launch brand-new products for the masses—or, more lately, to create developer tools to help myself and others get stuff done faster.</p>
